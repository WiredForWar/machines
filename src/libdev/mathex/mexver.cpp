    01.15   MexTransformRep removed. MexTransform3d is no longer parameterised
            over MexTransformRep. MexPoint3d, MexLine3d and MexPlane3d are no
            longer derived from MexBoundary3d. ALl MexBoundary 3ds can now
            take a transform to update their position in the world (as their
            owning object's position changes).

            elements to be set directly.
            21 January 1996  Bob Archer

    01.22   MexVec2 now has a zeroVector function.
            MexBox2 has a void constructor.
            21 January 1996  Bob Archer

            5 March 1996        Bob Archer

    01.27   Constructor added to MexAlignedBox3d to allow it to be
            constructed from its centre point and its overall X, Y
            and Z dimensions.
            7 March 1996        Bob Archer

    01.28   rotateAboutAxis function added to MexPoint3d.
            8 March 1996        Bob Archer

    01.29   zeroBox function added to MexAlignedBox3d.
            8 March 1996        Bob Archer

	01.30	inlined functions restricted to simple functions
			13 March 1996		Olly Headey

    01.31   Fixed bug in rotateAboutAxis postconditions which would
            cause an incorrect assertion if the point to be rotated
            was on the axis of rotation.
            13 March 1996       Bob Archer
            
    01.32   lmo and rmo had been swapped over - they have now been
            defined to be the right way round.            
            19 March 1996       Bob Archer
            
    01.33   Interval functions in mathex.tpp now work properly:

            ( .ctp, .itp, .ctf and .itf files )
            19 May 1996                         Bob Archer

	01.35	Minor error fixes (point3d.ctp to point3d.itp)

			and consistency with MexPoint3d.
			20 May 1996							Olly Headey

			3 June 1996							Jerry Swan

	01.38	Replaced EPSILON with singleton template class MexEpsilon.

			which is overloaded for scalars and MexFix16Pt16.
			6 June 1996							Jerry Swan

    01.39   Fixed bug in MexVec3 class - the functions for setting y
            and z were actually setting the x value.
            26 June 1996                        Bob Archer

    01.40   #undef min and #undef max added to the top of fix.hpp to
            allow the mathex library to compile under windows.
            9 July 1996                        Bob Archer

    01.41   Compiled with new base library
            7 August 1996                       Bob Archer

    01.42   The width and height functions in MexAlignedBox2d have
            been changed so that they do not add one onto their return
            value. This is a reasonable thing to do for integer
            instantiations but not reasonable for floating point
            instantiations. The isEmpty function has been removed
            until we can agree on a reasonable interpretation of its
            results.

            In MexAlignedBox3d the width, height and isEmpty
            functions have all been removed.
            
            4th November 1996                       Bob Archer
			
	01.43	Templates have been removed from the 2D geometry classes.

			New 2D geometry classes were added: MexLine2d, MexHalfPlane2d, 
			MexPolygon2d and MexTriangle2d.
			
			Traingle-box and line-box intersection methods were added to 
			MexAlignedBox2d.
			
			Methods minCorner and maxCorner were added to MexAlignedBox2d.
			These replace topLeft and bottomRight which are now depreciated.
			
			Various stream insertion and extraction ops. were added.
			
			9 December 1996							Iain Cantlay

    01.44   MexAlignedBox2d::topLeft, MexAlignedBox2d::bottomRight,
            MexAlignedBox2d::width, MexAlignedBox2d::height all removed.
            Use minCorner instead of topLeft and maxCorner instead of
            bottomRight.
            
            10 December 1996                        Bob Archer

    01.45   MexIntersectData class removed.
            MexHalfSpace3d class temporarily removed.
            MexTransform3dKey class added.
            MexTransform3d class has MexTransform3dKey by value.
            Following methods added to MexTransform3d:
                void preTransform( const MexTransform3d& t);
                void transform( const MexTransform3d& t, MexTransform3d* pResult ) const;
                void setTransform( const MexFloatMatrix3d m );
                void getTransform( MexFloatMatrix3d m ) const;
                const MexTransform3dKey& key( void ) const;
                void xBasis( MexVec3* ) const;
                void yBasis( MexVec3* ) const;
                void zBasis( MexVec3* ) const;
            MexBoundary3d, MexAlignedBox3d, MexUnalignedBox3d ::intersects and ::contains
            methods changed to take world transforms as arguments, instead of storing the
            world transform.
            MexAlignedBox3d has new methods makeSpinSafe() and realign() to enhance usefulness
            for rotated objects. Also, the way in which the world transform is applied was
            changed so that the centroid is transformed properly, and the box 'rotates' around
            the centroid to maintain alignment (if realign flag not set).

            11 March 1997                   Jonathan Green

    01.46   Added the MexBoundary3dPtr typedef (with instantiation) which provides a reference
            counted interface for MexBoundary3ds.
            Implemented double dispatching for MexBoundary3d::contains().

            13 March 1997                   Jonathan Green

    01.47   Added MexEulerParameters class.
            Extended MexTransform3d class to get/set rotation using MexEulerParameters

            25 March 1997                   Jonathan Green

    01.48   MexEulerAngles class removed temporarily as its rotations were working
            in the wrong direction. It has been romoved to ensure that any code
            using it breaks noisily. It will be introduced at a later date. In
            the meantime, use MexEulerParameters.
            3 April 1997                        Bob Archer

    01.49   MexVec3::cross_product renamed to crossProduct.    
            MexVec3::dot_product renamed to dotProduct.    
            5 April 1997                        Bob Archer

    01.50   The MexTransform3d constructor which takes a MexEulerParameters
            argument was not initialising the position values. This has now
            been fixed.
            9 April 1997                        Bob Archer
			
	01.51	Added a MexQuad3d class.

    01.52   Reintroduced MexEulerAngles class
            16 April 1997                       Bob Archer

    01.53   Output operator added to MexEulerAngles class
            24 April 1997                       Bob Archer

    01.54   MexDegrees and MexRadians classes added.
            MexEulerParameters has been renamed to MexQuaternion. The
            class has been tidied up. The constructor from azimuth,
            elevation and roll angles has been removed.
            All references to angles now use MexRadians. This includes
            MexEulerAngles, MexQuaternions and MexPoint3d.

            MexTransform3d:
                const MATHEX_SCALAR* xBasis() const;

                MexTransform3d( const MATHEX_SCALAR* translation );
                MexTransform3d(
                    const MATHEX_SCALAR *xBasis,
                    const MATHEX_SCALAR *yBasis,
                    const MATHEX_SCALAR *zBasis,
                    const MATHEX_SCALAR *position );

                void translate( const MATHEX_SCALAR * );
                void transformVector( MATHEX_SCALAR* v ) const;
                all removed.

                void position( MexPoint3d* pPos ) const;
                MexTransform3d( const MexEulerAngles& );
                MexTransform3d( const MexPoint3d& );
                MexTransform3d( const MexQuaternion&, const MexPoint3d& );
                MexTransform3d( const MexEulerAngles&, const MexPoint3d& );
                void translate( const MexPoint3d& );
                void rotate( const MexEulerAngles& );
                void rotate( const MexQuaternion& );
                void position( const MexPoint3d& newPosition );
                MexVec3 xBasis( void ) const;
                MexVec3 yBasis( void ) const;
                MexVec3 zBasis( void ) const;
                MexPoint3d  position( void ) const;
                MexEulerAngles  rotationAsEulerAngles( void ) const;
                MexQuaternion  rotationAsQuaternion( void ) const;
                all added.

                void transformVector( MexVec3* pVector ) const;
                    changed to
                void transform( MexVec3* pVector ) const;
                
                void transformPoint( MexPoint3d* pPoint ) const;
                    changed to
                void transform( MexPoint3d* pPoint ) const;

                The inverse of a transform is no longer cached.

            MexVec3:
                MexVec3( const MATHEX_SCALAR* );
            	const MexVec3& operator =( const MATHEX_SCALAR* );
                operator MATHEX_SCALAR *();
                operator MATHEX_SCALAR const *() const;
                removed

                MATHEX_SCALAR EuclidianDistance( const MexVec3* vPtr ) const;
                    changed to
                MATHEX_SCALAR euclidianDistance( const MexVec3& ) const;

            MexPoint3d:
                MexPoint3d( const MATHEX_SCALAR * );
                const MexPoint3d& operator =( const MATHEX_SCALAR * );
                operator MATHEX_SCALAR *();
                operator MATHEX_SCALAR const *() const;
                removed

    01.55   Added Point2d class
            Added constructor for MexVec2 taking a MexPoint2d.
            Added constructor for MexVec2, to compute unit vector from 2 MexPoint2ds,
            with optional length divisor.
            Added method makeUnitVector() to MexVec2.
            Added method normal() to MexVec2.

            Added methods to MexPolygon2d to control caching of data,
            and test for intersection with a line joining 2 points.
            Removed method from MexPolygon2d returning non-const reference
            to a vertex, in case modifications to a vertex by the client
            violate the invariant of the polygon sub-class.
            Added MexConvexPolygon2d class.
            12 May 1997                       Jonathan Green

    01.56   Added new constructors to MexAlignedBox2d and MexConvexPolygon2d.            
            1 July 1997                       Jonathan Green

    01.57   Removed MexPoint3d::centre. Its implementation was meaningless.

    01.60   Added MexConvexPolygon2d::MexConvexPolygon2d( const Points& points )
            constructor to allow a polygon to be created from a vector of
            points (as opposed to pointers to points )
