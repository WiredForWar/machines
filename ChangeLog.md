Current dev build (to be released as v1.7.1):
- Implemented 2X UI scaling (a lot of HD textures wanted)
- Implemented recent events manager (to cycle through the positions of the last important events with SpaceBar key)

- Added the same type selection by Ctrl-click or double click
- Shift+click now toggles selection

- Screenshots are now saved as PNG rather than BMP format
- Navigation button with counter now uses TTF instead of BMP font
