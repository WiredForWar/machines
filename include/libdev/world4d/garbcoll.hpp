    W4dGarbageCollector

    This singleton class is used to queue the deletion of W4dEntities at or soon after
    a specified time.
    This is especially useful for example, for temporary objects which appear as part
    of special effects.
    The client must ensure that any entity registered here is not deleted by any other
    means, or double deletion will occur. However, this object does not delete its
    entities on destruction at the end of the program - they would be destructed
    automatically by their parent destructors.
